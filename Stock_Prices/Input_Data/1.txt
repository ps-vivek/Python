Corporate history
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, 
David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which 
was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] 
which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, 
leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]

In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company 
themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]

In June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[12]

In December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging extensive intellectual property infringement.[13]
