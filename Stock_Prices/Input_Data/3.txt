Arista developed a module dubbed CloudVision[19] that extends the CLI to use XMPP as a shared message bus for managing and configuring switches.[20] 
This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.

Programmability
In addition to all the standard programming and scripting capabilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:

Advanced Event Management[21] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when 
state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.
Event Monitor tracks changes made to the MAC, ARP, and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard SQL queries.[22]
eAPI (External API)[23] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.
Ethernet switches
Arista's product line can be separated in eight families:

7500E series: Modular chassis with a VOQ fabric supporting up to 4 or 8 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 
100GbE[24] performance in a 30Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 1152 10GbE ports with 144GB of packet buffer. Each 100GbE ports can also operate 
as 3x40G or 12x10G ports,[25] thus effectively providing 120Gb of line-rate capacity per port.
7300 series: Modular chassis with 4, 8, or 16 line cards with 2.56Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 40Tbit/s of capacity for 
up to 2048 10GbE ports.[26] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.
7200 series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 40GbE switches, with 5.12Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[27]
7100 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. The 7124SX has a sub 500ns port-to-port latency, regardless of the 
frame size.[4]
The 7124FX, dubbed the "Application Switch,"[28] includes an Altera FPGA capable of processing 8 x 10Gbit/s, which made possible "cut-through 
high-frequency trading," in which algorithmically generated trades were incurring an additional latency of only 176ns.[29]
7150 series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[30] Unlike the 
7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[31] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as VXLAN or NAT/PAT.
7050 series: 1U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10Gb and 40Gb switches. This product line offers a higher port density than the 7100 series, with a 
minimum of 52 x 10GbE ports, at the expense of slightly increased latency (1.2µs or less).
7048 series: 1U store and forward line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 768MB of packet memory.
7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10Gb uplinks.[32]
The low-latency of Arista switches has made the platform prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[33] (
largest U.S. options exchange), Lehman Brothers[34] or RBC Capital Markets.[35] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[36]

Arista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[37] including IGMP, VRRP, RIP, BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, as well as OpenFlow. 
The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 ECMP, and applying per-port L3/L4 ACLs entirely in hardware.

All of Arista's switches are built using merchant silicon instead of custom switching ASICs. This strategy enables Arista to leverage 
latest advances in processor manufacturing technology at a lower price point, due to the prohibitive costs associated with the development 
and production of custom chips. Other major competitors such as Cisco and Juniper have also started following the same strategy,[38] 
which led to multiple competing products built on top of the same chips. For instance Broadcom's Trident chip is used in some Cisco 
Nexus switches, Juniper QFX switches, Force10, IBM and HP switches.[39] The integration of the chips with the rest of the system 
including integration with the MAC, PHY, and device drivers on the control plane) and software are what differentiate the competing products.

In November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, which aims to cut operational costs.[40]

Corporate history
Andy Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. In 1995, 
David Cheriton co-founded Granite Systems with Bechtolsheim, a company that developed Gigabit Ethernet products, which 
was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1996.[7] In 2001, Cheriton and Bechtolsheim founded another start up, Kealia,[8] 
which was acquired by Sun in 2004. From 1996 to 2003, Bechtolsheim and Cheriton occupied executive positions at Cisco, 
leading the development of the Catalyst product line, along with Kenneth Duda who had been Granite Systems' first employee.[9]

In 2004, the three then went on to found Arastra (later renamed Arista[2]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company 
themselves.[10] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the company, and was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[11]
